## A Python Weather App built with the OpenWeather API

This project fetches the current weather for a city, chosen by the user through input taken in by the api_utils file in the city_to_search() function.

I also created a function in the api_filter.py file to take user input on a temperature. That file holds a list of cities. Any city greater than or equal to the user's input temp is added to a csv file.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html - work with the OS (file paths, etc)

# Challenges:

Forgetting to remove stuff I tested with that was bloating my files!
Also, doing research on working with CSV's
